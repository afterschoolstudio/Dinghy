* sourcegen
	* ideally leverage https://github.com/scriban/scriban for easy templating
		* also being able to provide templates to end-users to easily bind for arbitrary scenarios would be cool
	* ldtk
	* aseprite
	* depot
	* razor pages
		* use a razor compiler lib to spit out proper ui pages to be displayed and bound against

	* releaser wrapper
* https://github.com/xoofx/zio
